# Meta Chat v1.0.0

**The enhanced templates provide production-grade, fully documented schemas with comprehensive defaults and validation rules, whereas the initial version offered only basic structural templates without detailed guidance for real-world implementation.**  

Key upgrades include:  
✅ Complete metadata tracking  
✅ Smart defaults for all fields  
✅ Built-in validation and error prevention  
✅ Internationalization and accessibility support  
✅ AI-specific context hints  

This transforms the templates from simple data structures into robust contracts between your app and the AI generator.
